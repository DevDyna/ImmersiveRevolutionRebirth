<h1>The Immersive Revolution Mk.2</h1>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>I will be releasing BETA versions that are just that! Expect massive changes and overhauls to happen! The initial beta I launch will strictly be a base version of only mods and quests. DO NOT download the betas if you are not looking to play an in-development pack!</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a vast world full of ores and monsters you stand alone. Using the materials around, develop machinery to move through the Tiers and gain newer and superior technology. Start with rotational force and a mysterious world to move your way up to robotic suits and resource plants! Will you take on this challenge and delve into the unknown?</p>
